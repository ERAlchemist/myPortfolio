**Summary**<br>
I built this to help me in my job search.  It allows for tracking job prospects (jobs I should apply for), jobs (jobs I did apply for), and allows for tracking certain items such as technologies, company, a personal rating (how good the job seems), etc.<br><br>

**The Tech**<br>
The app was built with Rails 5.2 and styled using [UI-Kit](https://github.com/uikit/uikit) which is an awesome lightweight, modular front-end framework for developing fast, responsive, mobile-first web interfaces.<br><br>
