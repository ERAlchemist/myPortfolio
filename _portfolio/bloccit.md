**Summary**<br>
Bloccit was one of the backend projects I worked on while in the Bloc program and the first RubyOnRails application that I ever built.  It is a web application that allows users to create topics and posts as well as favorite them. It was built using Test Driven Development (TDD) and all aspects of the app were custom built, including authentication and authorization.  It was a great intoduction to the fundamentals of backend programming and Rails. <br>
